Launching & Operating Instructions
==================================

When the program is run: 
	- the user can select which image they'd like to use for their puzzle from the options on the top right
	- once a selection is made, the user can click the start button to begin the game
	- a piece of the original image is randomly removed and the remaining pieces are shuffled and placed onto the game board
	- the user can click the piece they'd like to shift to the blank space
	- once the image is re-shaped into its original appearance, the missing piece is inserted into the blank space to form the complete original image and the timer stops
